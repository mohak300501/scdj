        '''This shloka is part of Ganga-Lahari (Waves of Ganga), composed by Pandit Jagannath.<br>
      The story behind this famous composition is as interesting as the essence of the shloka itself. Pandit Jagannath, when faced with
      a terrible crisis, decides to please Mother Ganga by singing verses in her praise. He composes 52 shlokas there and then on the
      banks of Ganga, and with each shloka, she (Mother Ganga) rises one step. Eventually, the great pandit becomes one with her, that is,
      he dies a noble death.<br>This particular shloka, composed in the viparītākhyānikī (विपरीताख्यानिकी) meter, is the 52nd shloka of Ganga-Lahari, and exemplifies the
      genius of Pandit Jagannath. The repetition of the ङ्ग sound is the key feature - the literary device of alliteration is used, but
      the arrangement of the adjectives used for Ganga is the true beauty; remember he was doing it extempore!<br><br>विभूषिता अनङ्ग-रिपु-उत्तम-अङ्गा The one who adorns the upper-most part of the enemy of Ananga [Lord of Kama], that is, the one who adorns

        of Samasya Pooranam (समस्या-पूरणम्), organised by the great King Bhoj.<br> Such competitions were commonly organised by advocates of literature and scholarship, and Raja Bhoj is one of the most reknowned in this respect.<br> In the particular
        context of this subhashitam, Raja Bhoj gives a seemingly non-sensical line 'tham tham thatham tham thathatham thatham thah' as a challenge for the assembly of intellectuals gathered in his court, and this subhashitam is the clever solution
        of Kalidasa to it.<br><br> राज्याभिषेके In the grand coronation ceremony of the king,<br> हेम-घटः च्युतः the golden pot fell away<br> मदविह्वलायाः तरुण्याः हस्तात् from the hands of an excited young girl (so excited about the coronation

        capturing the sound made by the pot at each step. But both Kalidasa and Raja Bhoj show how rhythm and harmony can be found even in the events we would otherwise perceive as noise; for we see, the 'meaningless' string of sounds actually
        follows the melodiuos meter of indravajrā (इन्द्रवज्रा)!!<br> Such were the pastimes of the scholars!'''),
