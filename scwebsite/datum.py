        '''This shloka is part of Ganga-Lahari (Waves of Ganga), composed by Pandit Jagannath.<br>
      The story behind this famous composition is as interesting as the essence of the shloka itself. Pandit Jagannath, when faced with
      a terrible crisis, decides to please Mother Ganga by singing verses in her praise. He composes 52 shlokas there and then on the
      banks of Ganga, and with each shloka, she (Mother Ganga) rises one step. Eventually, the great pandit becomes one with her, that is,
      he dies a noble death.<br>This particular shloka, composed in the viparītākhyānikī (विपरीताख्यानिकी) meter, is the 52nd shloka of Ganga-Lahari, and exemplifies the
      genius of Pandit Jagannath. The repetition of the ङ्ग sound is the key feature - the literary device of alliteration is used, but
      the arrangement of the adjectives used for Ganga is the true beauty; remember he was doing it extempore!<br><br>विभूषिता अनङ्ग-रिपु-उत्तम-अङ्गा The one who adorns the upper-most part of the enemy of Ananga [Lord of Kama], that is, the one who adorns

      are crying! This is somewhat contradictory to the common sense, as Krishna was on the side of Pandavas and against Kauravas,

        context of this subhashitam, Raja Bhoj gives a seemingly non-sensical line 'tham tham thatham tham thathatham thatham thah' as a challenge for the assembly of intellectuals gathered in his court, and this subhashitam is the clever solution

        capturing the sound made by the pot at each step. But both Kalidasa and Raja Bhoj show how rhythm and harmony can be found even in the events we would otherwise perceive as noise; for we see, the 'meaningless' string of sounds actually
        follows the melodiuos meter of indravajrā (इन्द्रवज्रा)!!<br> Such were the pastimes of the scholars!'''),
